# Dynamics of a triangular billiard

A particle is free to move with constant velocity within the boundaries of two symmetrical segments, characterised by the parameters Y1, Y2, and L.

The particle starts moving from a point on the Y-axis, in between Y1 and -Y1, and with an initial angle theta. In case of collision, it is reflected according to physical laws.

The simulation ends when the particle's X-coordinate is equal to L. Given the particle's initial parameters Y0 and Theta0, Y_Final and Theta_Final are determined.
